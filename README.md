# Django Blog
 
## About

Simple Blog App written using Django.

This is the first full-featured web application I've written. I studied this from 
Corey Schafer on Youtube. It's really a great channel for anything related to Python,
much better than paid courses on other learning websites.

Live Demo: [https://django-blog-rom.herokuapp.com/](https://django-blog-rom.herokuapp.com/)

Most of the common web application technology/process are applied
in creating this web app such as:
- Web fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Bootstrap
- Jinja
- Model-View-Template Design Pattern
- User registration
- User authentication
- Forgot password email reset feature (I used Gmail SMTP)
- Database (Object Relational Mapping)
- CRUD operations
- Local file upload
- AWS S3 file upload
- Deployment (I used Heroku)

## Notes:
Cloning this directly won't work. You need to install the modules listed in
requirements.txt and you need to set the following environment variables in your system.
- SECRET_KEY
- DEBUG
- EMAIL_HOST_USER
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
