### About

Still in progress...

This is my first full-featured web application written using Django 
Python Framework. This is a blog app where most of the common functionalities of a web application can be built such as:

* Model-View-Template design pattern. 
* User registration.
* User authentication.
* User forgot password email reset.
* Database.
* Object Relational Mapping.
* Jinja.
* Bootstrap.
* CRUD operation for users.
* CRUD operations for admin.
* File upload.
* Connect to Amazon Web Services. 
* Deployment

### How to Use

This is written in Python 3.8.3
You need to install the following in requirements.txt
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
or you configured your system to use pip3 command then:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

To run the server, type:

```python manage.py runserver```

or if you configured your system to use python3 command then:

```python3 manage.py runserver```

Then access it through your browser by the address:

```localhost:8000```
